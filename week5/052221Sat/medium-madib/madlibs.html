      The majestic <span class="animal"></span> has roamed the forests of 
      <span class="country"></span> for thousands of years. Today, she wanders
      in search of <span class="pluralNoun"></span>. She must find food to
      survive. While hunting for <span class="food"></span>, she found a 
      <span class="device"></span> hidden behind a <span class="noun"></span>.
      Suddenly, the device turned on and started to become <span class="adjective"></span>.
      The king of <span class="country"></span> suddenly appeared, jumped on top
      of the <span class="adjective"></span> <span class="device"></span> and floated
      off into the sunset.

    <p>
      The End.
